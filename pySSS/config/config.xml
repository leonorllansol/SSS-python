  <!-- Parameters for the multiagent mode of SaySomethingSmart

    defaultAgentsMode: Running mode of the framework
          classic     - Runs the default version of SSS (Lexical metrics, Magarreiro's)
          multi       - Runs the multiagent system, prompting the user for dialogue
          sequential  - Runs the multiagent system, reading questions from a text file sequentially 

    externalAgentsPath: Path to the externalAgents folder (default is resources/externalAgents)

    decisionMethod: Decision method to use. Current available decision methods are:
      SimpleMajority                     Each agent sends a single answer, and the most frequent answer given by the agents is the one delivered to the user
      PrioritySystem                     Agents have explicitly defined priorities (each agent sends a single answer);
                                         If an agent with the highest priority can answer the user's query, that answer is delivered to the user and other agents' answers are ignored;
                                         An agent with priority 1 has higher priority than an agent with priority 5;
                                         If an agent is not specified in the priority settings, the system will assume that it has a lower priority than the specified agents
      AgentMultiAnswers                  Similar to SimpleMajority, but each agent can deliver multiple possible answers instead of a single one;
                                         however, the user still only receives a single response;
      PrioritySystemMultiAnswers         Similar to PrioritySystem, but each agent can deliver multiple possible answers to be considered by the system instead of a single one;
                                         however, the user still only receives a single response;
      PrioritySystemDevelopmentMulti     Similar to PrioritySystemMultiAnswers, but the user receives multiple possible answers to the sent query;


    answerAmount: Number of answers to be delivered to the user (1 is the default); this parameter is only considered if the PrioritySystemDevelopmentMulti decision method is active.
